Text based RPG

All help appreciated. You can contact me at felixisaacp(at)gmail(dot)com.

A text based rpg with a turn based battle system, skills and item system.
No storyline involved since I am not creative in that aspect.
Currently only the battle system is working as I am still designing the others.

Future plan is to incorporate a 2d graphics into it using SDL.
