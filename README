All help appreciated. You can contact me at felixisaacp(at)gmail(dot)com.

No storyline involved since I am not creative in that aspect.
Future plan is to incorporate a 2d graphics into it using SDL.

Current features:
3 different classes: Warrior, Mage or Ranger.
Turn based battle system, similar to Pokemon.
Enemy difficulty relative to your character's level.

In-development:
Skills system. Up to 5 stackable mods for the player and/or enemy. Passive skills are excluded from this count.

Future developments:
Items.
2D graphics.
